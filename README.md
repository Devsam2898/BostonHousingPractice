# Boston Housing Price Dataset

This repository contains the Boston Housing Price dataset, which is commonly used for regression analysis and predictive modeling tasks. The dataset provides information about various factors that may affect the median value of owner-occupied homes in different suburbs of Boston.

## Dataset Description

The Boston Housing Price dataset consists of the following features:

1. CRIM: Per capita crime rate by town.
2. ZN: Proportion of residential land zoned for lots over 25,000 square feet.
3. INDUS: Proportion of non-retail business acres per town.
4. CHAS: Charles River dummy variable (1 if tract bounds river; 0 otherwise).
5. NOX: Nitric oxides concentration (parts per 10 million).
6. RM: Average number of rooms per dwelling.
7. AGE: Proportion of owner-occupied units built prior to 1940.
8. DIS: Weighted distances to five Boston employment centers.
9. RAD: Index of accessibility to radial highways.
10. TAX: Full-value property tax rate per $10,000.
11. PTRATIO: Pupil-teacher ratio by town.
12. B: 1000(Bk - 0.63)^2 where Bk is the proportion of blacks by town.
13. LSTAT: Percentage of lower status of the population.
14. MEDV: Median value of owner-occupied homes in $1000s (target variable).
